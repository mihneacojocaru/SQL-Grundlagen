//--- Relational Queries

//+++ Inner Joins aka General Join:

select * from likes inner join follows on likes.photo_id=follows.followee_id;

### Get specific columns from a tabel where they join another table on a specific criteria. 

select tags_info.id,tag_name from tags as tags_info
inner join users as user_info 
on tags_info.id = user_info.id;

### Inner Joining from multiple tables:

select users.id,users.username from users
inner join likes on users.id = likes.photo_id
inner join tags on users.id = tags.id;

____________________________________________

select *
from users
inner join posts
on users.id = posts.user_id;

//+++ Outer Joins

### LEFT OUTER JOIN 

select users.id,users.username from users
left outer join photos
on users.id = photos.user_id;

+++ How many posts does each user have

select name, count(users.id) as posts_number from users
left outer join posts
on users.id = posts.user_id
group by name;

//+++ UNION

If you have the same columns in more than one table you can query with union all of the info in the same table.

select users.id,users.name
from users union
select posts.text,posts.posted_at from posts;

//+++ UNION all

Selects all table elements, even if there are duplicates.

select users.name as Names from users
union all select posts.text as Post from posts;
